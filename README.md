# flan-chanbot
A self-hosted bot for your server! (NOTE: this was mainly built for [touhou  discord](https://discord.gg/fdDPbm2))

# Running and configuring it 
1. You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
2. Click "Clone or Download" button and choose "Download ZIP"
3. (On most os's) right click the downloaded zip file and "unpack" or whatever the button is called for you in your locale
4. Open the cmd/terminal, type this command `npm install --no-optional` and press enter
5. Now open up `botConfig.json` with notepad/notepad++ or any text editor you please and change the things you want to change but either a token or email/password (for getting the token please go to [applications](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), create a app there with a bot user and copy the token from there)
6. Last step is to just `node bots.js`
7. Congrats the bot is now alive!
