#Code Formatting

- use the proper way of formatting your fixes. Refer to meew's Discord Bot coding practices and the nodejs coding practices.

# Pull Requests

- your PRs from your forks should be always using the latest code from master(otherwise, prepare for the most cryptic shit that ever happened, a git conflict).
- make sure it doesn't conflict with the other Pull Requests.

# the <Unspoken> Extra guidlines...

- you can meme in your commits/PRs (although don't go full weeb or the Romaji/Kanji is going to the trash bin).
- Comments can also contain memes, but keep the comments maintain their original purpose: to make ppl understand a certain medthod.
