#Code Formatting

- use the proper way of formatting your fixes. Refer to meew's Discord Bot coding practices and the nodejs coding practices.

# Pull Requests

- your PRs from your forks should be always using the latest development code.
- make sure it doesn't conflict with the other Pull Requests.

# the <Unspoken> Extra guidlines...

- you can meme in your commits/PRs (although don't go full weeb or the Romaji/Kanji is going to the trash bin).
- Comments can be formatted the way library devs does on their code (i.e made by someone who sucks at CS:GO is a good reminder to everyone :^)).
- :eyes: Antony pls.
